# Todo-list app built with React
## Project Overview
This project is a simple todo-list page, based on a Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW). User can add/remove todos, 
filter through completed and active, as well as providing two themes to choose from (dark / light). Also, the app is responsive for mobile users and utilizes local storage to store the 
chosen theme and todos.
